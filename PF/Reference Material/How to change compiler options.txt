Some functions/features are introduced in later versions of C++ compiler. For example, many useful string functions are only available in C++11. You can change settings of your compiler to use the appropriate version of the compiler. 

In Dev C++:
Click to Tools | Compiler Options.
Click to Settings | Code Generation.
Change the value of Language Standard (-std) to ISO C++11.

This eventually changes the compile command to:

g++ test.cpp -o -std=c++11
